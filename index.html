  Welcome to my personal page. This entire page, with the exception of
  media like images and fonts, is contained in this one file. This file
  was hand-written by me, from scratch, with no frameworks. After
  spending many years doing non-web-dev work, I wanted to get a sense
  of what the modern web is capable of. For better or worse, in the end
  this project strained my design muscles more than my programming
  muscles. Visual and experiece design is hard; respect the designers
  in your team, folks.

              <p>Hi, I'm Aaron.</p>
              <p>
                I'm a Principal Engineer and tech lead of the software
                development team at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's
                Encrypt</a>, the world's largest free and open certificate
                authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of my role, I contribute heavily both to the <a
                href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>
                developing interoperability standards for the modern web, and to
                the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a>
                developing the rules and regulations which set the standard of
                behavior for certificate authorities around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialize in developer-facing tooling, and have previously
                worked on Infrastructure, Operations, and Developer Experience
                teams. I enjoy doing work which directly benefits my colleagues,
                due to the fast feedback loops and due to the virtuous cycle in
                which it makes my own life better at the same time.
               </p>
               <p>
                 I believe in doing the right thing, equal rights and
                 opportunities for everyone, and petting cats.

              <p>
                The Chromium project runs what is, as far as I know, the largest
                open-source continuous integration build and test automation
                system in the world. We call it
                <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-py/ target="_blank"">Luci</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pre-submit system (the "Commit Queue")
                processes 1,500 commits per day, building and testing each one
                on a minimum of 25 different platform configurations and running
                almost 900 parallel hours of tests on a fleet of over 15,000 hosts.
                The post-submit system encompasses over 500 different platform
                configurations. And that's all just for the main
                <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src" target="_blank">chromium repository</a>
                itself, not including any of its 200+ dependencies, many of which
                we also run CI systems for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since early 2019, I have been Technical Lead and manager
                of the team responsible for the configuration, capacity planning,
                and performance improvements of this entire system. Over the course
                of that year we improved the median wall-clock run time of the CQ
                by 20% (from 48 to 38 minutes). We also expanded both the pre-submit
                and post-submit systems to cover Chromium's release branches, increasing
                overall throughput by 11% without increasing cost.

                I spent fall semester of 2018 teaching Introduction to Computer Science
                at Xavier University of Louisiana through the Googler in Residence program.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/googleinresidence/" target="_blank">GIR program</a>
                sends experienced software engineers to teach at Historically Black Colleges
                and Universities such as XULA in order to support greater diversity in the
                tech industry. Over the course of the semester I was able to introduce a generation
                of new students to the fundamentals of computer science via Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have experience in curriculum development, including writing an entire
                introductory course from scratch: syllabus, lesson plans, lectures, quizzes,
                homework, projects, and exams. I also hosted interview prep sessions, tutored
                individual students, and hosted one wild hackathon (see above).
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, a record number of students from Xavier landed summer internships
                with major tech companies, and the students and program at Xavier continue to
                grow.

                Monorail is the bug and issue tracking system used by the Chromium
                project, as well as a variety of related projects. Since 2016 it has hosted
                over 1,000,000 issues and 3,000 daily active users for Chromium alone,
                facilitating collaboration between engineers, engagement with the
                community, and improvements to the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was one of the creators of Monorail, to replace the Google Code
                issue tracker when it was being shut down in 2015. I wrote
                features, designed and executed the data migration, and
                <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/f2e2a4d6f45e7791041d4fc48041b6d2206f8b3f" target="_blank">open-sourced</a>
                the whole codebase.
              </p>
              <p>  
                I continued to own, develop, and maintain Monorail until late 2018.
                During that time I also owned our entire developer workflow stack,
                including our <a href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html" target="_blank">command-line SDK</a>,
                our <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium" target="_blank">code search and indexing</a> system,
                and our <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com" target="_blank">code review tool</a>.
                During this time I also managed and grew a team of 3 other engineers
                to work on our developer tools.
