        <h2>Finite Element Modeling and Simulation</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_atc.html">AtC</a>
          (Atoms-to-Continuum) package is a plugin for <a
          href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/">LAMMPS</a> (Large-scale
          Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) designed and written at
          <a href="http://sandia.gov">Sandia National Lab</a>.  I am currently
          working on adding new functionality to the software, as well as
          improving its overall runtime performance. For instance, my team and I
          are giving AtC the ability to use more complex mesh geometries (such
          as heterogeneous tetrahedra), the ability to make approximations using
          quadratic and and higher-order interpolation functions, and adding
          spatial-partitioning methods for parallelization.

        <h2>YouTube Personalized Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> spends a lot of time and
          energy providing recommendations to users on what videos they might
          like to watch and what channels they might want to subscribe to.
          Traditionally, these recommendations are based on each user's
          individual watch history and set of subscriptions. However, new users
          don't have this library of information available. I worked on
          implementing a system to improve "<a
          href="http://www.youtube.com/finish_ssu">cold start</a>"
          recommendations for brand new users. My improvements resulted in a
          significant increase in click-through rate in the suggestions pane.

        <h2>Complex Networks in Twitter</h2>
        <p>
          During my semester abroad at <a href="http://ait-budapest.com">AIT
          Budapest</a>, I took a course on the Structure and Dynamics of Complex
          Networks as well as a pair of half-courses on Data Mining. These
          classes culminated in a project in which I conducted extensive data
          mining on retweet patterns in <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
          I showed that the basic characteristics of the information-spread
          networks can be used to classify individual tweets as being personal,
          newsworthy, or regarding popular culture. In the process, I also
          defined a new measured that I called "flux centrality", which is
          related to the statistical probability that a particle flowing through
          the network would pass through a given edge. The flux centrality of a
          simple lattice with a source and sink in opposite corners is shown at left.

        <h2>Finite Element Model Construction</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://meshing.lanl.gov">LaGriT</a> (the Los Alamos Grid
          Toolbox) is an application for the creation of large and complex
          Finite Element meshes. While the creation of a simple rectangular /
          octahedral mesh is relatively simple, advanced applications require
          that certain parts of the mesh fall along pre-determined surfaces,
          such as the earthquake fault shown at right. Generating a "nice"
          triangulation of such complex geometries is an NP-complete problem
          that is the subject of much active study. I spent three months adding
          features to the LaGriT package. My two primary contributions were
          adding the capability to stretch and deform a mesh to fill a volume,
          and the ability to insert a 2D surface into a 3D mesh, preserving the
          triangles of the surface as faces of tetrahedra in the final mesh.

        <h2>Platitude</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2010/fall/cs121/Platitude/">
          Platitude</a> was the term-long, class-wide project of my Large-scale
          Software Development class, taught by visiting professor <a
          href="http://alexandrefrancois.org">Alexandre Francois</a>. The game
          was a hybrid platformer / tower-defense experience, where 6 players
          (the platformers) tried to cross an expansive level while 1 player
          (the defender) built towers and other obstacles to stop them. The
          game, including its music, networking, and physics engines, was built
          from scratch on top of <a
          href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">GLuT</a> and
          the <a href="http://mfsm.sourceforge.net">SAI/MFSM</a> concurrency
          framework.

        <h2>Visual Identification of Arthropods</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/bugid/">BugID</a> project
          is focused on the joint development of robot image capture techniques
          and advanced computer vision algorithms for automated identification
          of arthropods (aquatic insects, soil mesofauna, and zooplankton). The
          final goal of the project is to develop self-contained systems that
          could conduct population and biodiversity surveys in the field. I
          assisted in the design, implementation, and testing of feature
          detection algorithms. I also contributed improvements to the manual
          classification user interface and the robotic camera control module.

        <h2>Text Clouds</h2>
        <p>
          This simple <a href="http://cs.hmc.edu/~agable/clouds.html">text
          cloud</a> page was the final project for the first introductory
          computer science course I took at Harvey Mudd. Implemented entirely in
          Python, it crawls a website following links to a depth of 5, extracts
          human-readable text from the HTML, stems the words, and displays text
          clouds based on the relative frequencies of words found in the final
          corpus. Try it on a book at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">Project
          Gutenberg</a> for some fun results.
